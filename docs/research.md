### Research Interests:

My primary research interest is the [transient](https://astrobites.org/2022/10/30/guide-to-transient-astronomy/) high-energy phenomena known as gamma-ray bursts. These are pulses of gamma-ray radiation that are observed from all over the sky.
They are primarily linked to the end of the stellar life cycle in that they are typically produced by either:
- [a collapsing massive star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapsar)
- [a collision between two compact objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817), in which case at least one of the compact objects has to be a neutron star.
