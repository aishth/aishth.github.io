## A general summary of my research:

My primary research interest is the [transient](https://astrobites.org/2022/10/30/guide-to-transient-astronomy/) high-energy phenomena known as gamma-ray bursts. These are pulses of gamma-ray radiation that are observed from all over the sky.
They are primarily linked to the end of the stellar life cycle in that they are typically produced by either:
- [a collapsing massive star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapsar)
- [a collision between two compact objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817), in which case at least one of the compact objects has to be a neutron star. 
<br>

The gamma-ray burst emission itself is produced by an accretion-powered relativistic jet that is launched from the remnant object, irrespective of the progenitor system. <br>
<br>
The emission from a GRB consists of the initial pulse of gamma-rays, called the prompt emission, which typically lasts for a timescale of seconds. The prompt emission is thought to arise from internal collisional shocks within the jet. <br>
<br>
The prompt-phase emission is followed by a longer-lived broadband electromagnetic transient that is called the afterglow emission, which can last from hours to years post-burst and is produced by the deceleration of particles accelerated in the jet by the surrounding medium.<br>
<br>

A neat consequence of these two separate progenitor systems is that GRBs and their resulting emission can be associated with two fundamentally very distinct environments.<br>
1. Collapsar-driven GRBs arise from a massive stellar progenitor and, as a result, are typically found in regions undergoing intense star formation within their host galaxies.
2. Merger-driven GRBs, on the other hand, require two explosions of the binary star components for them to end up as compact objects. As a result, these systems are found to be at a significant offset from their host galaxies. 

### Collapsar GRBs as probes of their environment

Typically, LGRBs can last a few seconds to several minutes. Their progenitors are generally massive stars undergoing core-collapse (collapsars) at the end of their lives. Collapsars are often found in regions of active star formation within galaxies, supporting the theory of their massive stellar origins.

#### Scientific Significance and Implications

Given their low angular offsets from their hosts, their bright and long-lived afterglow emission intercepts significant amounts of the medium along the line of sight. As a result, they can be used as probes of the medium in which the progenitor star evolved and exploded. This, coupled with their extreme brightness, means that we can use their afterglows to study the medium at very early epochs (12 Myr after the Big Bang) to understand how different it is from what we see around us today. <br> In particular, I use X-ray telescopes such as _XMM-Newton_, _Chandra_, _Swift-XRT_ and the newly launched _Einstein Probe_ to observe the afterglow spectra of LGRBs. I couple this X-ray data with optical spectra from telescopes such as _VLT_, _GTC_ and _Keck_, to produce a complete picture of the medium along our line of sight to the GRB. The detection of LGRBs at high redshifts enabled us to study the universe's evolution and the processes leading to the formation of the first stars and galaxies.

### Merger-driven GRBs as multimessenger sources

Merger-driven GRBs are causally linked to the coalescence of two compact objects after an inspiral, and this merger is detectable as a gravitational-wave (GW) signal. The first (and so far only) joint electromagnetic (EM)-GW detection of the binary neutron star event GW170817 ushered in the era of short GRBs as multimessenger sources. 

#### Scientific Significance and Implications

As merger-driven GRBs can be jointly detected in the GW and EM domains, their data can be jointly analysed to gain a deeper constraint on the properties of the merger system, which is not possible when using either dataset alone. In particular, the EM emission consists of two separate components: the GRB jet (non-thermal, X-ray to radio) and the kilonova (thermal, primarily optical and near-infrared). My primary interest in short GRBs is the kilonova emission, which is powered by the radioactive decay of elements synthesised in the post-merger environment. <br> I use optical telescopes such as the _VLT_ and _GTC_ to identify and monitor the evolution of the kilonova and thus understand how the system properties affect the produced emission. Additionally, I use radio telescopes such as _ATCA_ and _MeerKAT_ to study the GRB jets from such mergers.
