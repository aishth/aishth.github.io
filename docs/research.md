### Research Interests:

My primary research interest are the [transient](https://astrobites.org/2022/10/30/guide-to-transient-astronomy/) high-energy phenomena known as gamma-ray bursts. These are pulses of gamma-ray radiation that are observed from all over the sky.
They are primarily linked to the end of the stellar life cycle in that they are typically produced by either:
- [a collapsing massive star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapsar)
- [a collision between two compact objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817), in which case at least one of the compact objects has to be a neutron star. 
<br>

The gamma-ray burst emission itself is produced by an accretion-powered relativistic jet that is launched from the remnant object, irrespective of the progenitor system. <br>
<br>
The emission from a GRB consists of the initial pulse of gamma-rays, called as the prompt emission, which typically lasts for a timescale of seconds. The prompt emission is though to arise from internal collisional shocks within the jet. <br>
<br>
The prompt-phase emission is followed by a longer-lived broadband electromagnetic transient that is called the afterglow emission, which can last from hours to years post-burst and is produced by the deceleration of particles accelerated in the jet by the surrounding medium.<br>
<br>

A neat consequence of these two separate progenitor systems is that GRBs and their resulting emission can be associated to two fundamentally very distinct environments.<br>
1. Collapsar-driven GRBs arise from a massive stellar progenitor and as a result are typically found in regions undergoing intense star-formation within their host galaxies.
2. Merger-driven GRBs, on the other hand, require two explosions of the binary star components for them to end up as compact objects. As a result, these systems are found to be at a significant offset from their host galaxies.
