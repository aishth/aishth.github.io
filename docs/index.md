# Welcome!

Hi, I am Dr. Aishwarya Linesh Thakur. 
I am an astrophysicist working as a post-doctoral researcher at  
the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali in Rome, Italy.<br>

# Research

My main research interest is gamma-ray bursts. I perform and use multiwavelength observations of these fascinating sources to study their micro- and macro-physical properties.
