Hi, I am Dr. Aishwarya Linesh Thakur. I am an astrophysicist and I currently work as a post-doctoral researcher at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali in Rome, Italy.
Prior to this, I successfully defended my PhD thesis at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata.

In the meantime, here is a link to my [papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-9354-2308&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)
